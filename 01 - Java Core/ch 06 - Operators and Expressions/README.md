# Operators & Expressions

Java me operator means:

“Koi bhi symbol jo operands ke upar operation perform kare.”

Operand → data

Operator → kaam karne wala

Expression → combination of both

## Types of Operators in Java

Arithmetic Operators

Unary Operators

Relational Operators

Logical Operators

Bitwise Operators

Assignment Operators

Ternary Operator

Special Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
+, -, *, /, %

Important Notes:

✔ / integer division me decimal truncate ho jata hai

✔ % remainder deta hai

✔ If any operand is double → result double

✔ Java expression evaluation → left-to-right except assignment

Example:

System.out.println(10 / 3);  // 3

System.out.println(10 / 3.0); // 3.3333

### Unary Operators

+  -  ++  --  !  ~

### Relational Operators

<  >  <=  >=  ==  !=

### Logical Operators

&&   ||   !

### Bitwise Operators

&   |   ^   <<   >>   >>>

```
1) Bitwise AND → &

Both bits 1 → result 1

2) Bitwise OR → |

Any bit 1 → result 1

3) Bitwise XOR → ^

Bits different → result 1

4) Shift Operators
<<   Right shift
>>   Signed right shift
>>>  Unsigned right shift (fills 0)


Example:

10 << 1 = 20   (multiply by 2)
10 >> 1 = 5    (divide by 2)
```

### Assignment Operators

=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  <<=  >>=  >>>=

### Ternary Operators

(condition) ? value1 : value2
